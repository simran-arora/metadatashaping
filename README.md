# Metadata Shaping: A Simple Approach for Knowledge-Enhanced Language Models

Metadata Shaping is a simple and effective approach to enhance LMs with knowledge. The method involves inserting readily available entity metadata into examples based on mutual information, and training on the shaped data. More details about our approach are described in our ACL paper [Metadata Shaping: A Simple Approach for Knowledge-Enhanced Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08430)
